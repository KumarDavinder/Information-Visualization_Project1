# Information Visualization Project1
Draw 30 stars of various sizes and colors that move (slowly) moving away from the current mouse position (overlaps are allowed). 
When a star reaches the edge of the design, it reverses the route and moves to the current position of the mouse.

The project must be carried out individually using JavaScript and D3.js.

The attached project allows to move the stars in the directions: left, right, up, down, leftUp, rightUp, leftDown, rightDown.
Given the direction the stars reach a random point of the edge of the design.
